# CSP, WTF?

Sometimes, CSP notifications are __really difficult to understand or very strange__. Here is a collection of some CSP WTF.
If you have an idea (even if the idea is WTF) for some of these, do not hesitate to participate :)

As the list was becoming very (very!) long, I've splitted it in two categories:

- [CSP notifications that are explained](https://github.com/nico3333fr/CSP-useful/blob/master/csp-wtf/explained.md)
- [CSP notifications that are not explained yet](https://github.com/nico3333fr/CSP-useful/blob/master/csp-wtf/not-explained.md)

If you have some examples to share (even if you don't know what the fuck it is coming from), feel free to share them. Anonymize the URL/policy if needed.
